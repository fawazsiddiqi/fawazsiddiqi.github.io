# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am a developer and architect specializing in application modernization & integration, microservices, and data-driven systems. With a strong passion for technology, I constantly seek opportunities to learn, adapt quickly to new frameworks and languages, and apply this knowledge to solve complex challenges.

Beyond these focus areas, I also work across web development, frontend, and backend engineering, which broadens my perspective and enables me to design solutions that are both technically sound and business-oriented. I enjoy expanding my skillset and bringing innovative ideas to life based on hands-on experience.

Alongside my technical expertise, I have developed a deep understanding of digital transformation and IT strategy from a practical standpoint. This allows me to mentor teams and startupsâ€”helping them move from ideation and value proposition design to building and deploying scalable, production-ready solutions.
