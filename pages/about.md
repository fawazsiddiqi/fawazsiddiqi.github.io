# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am a developer focusing on Microservices, Data Science, and Blockchain. I always look forward to learning more and I adapt to new languages and frameworks very quickly. I look into various technologies besides my focus areas, including but not limited to web development, frontend, and backend development, I always look forward to expanding my skillset by gaining knowledge and emerge with innovative ideas based on my experience. Moreover, I am well versed with digital transformation and IT/Corporate strategies from a technical aspect allowing me to mentor teams and startups from building ideas, value proposition and deploying the solution to a production scale.
